	  <p>Time is the continued sequence of existence<br> 
and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession<br> 
from the past, through the present, into the future.<br> 
It is a component quantity of various measurements<br>
used to sequence events, to compare the duration<br> 
of events or the intervals between them,<br>
 and to quantify rates of change of quantities in<br>
 material reality or in the <span style="color:red">conscious experience</span>.
